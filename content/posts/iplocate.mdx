## About

IP Locate is a tool for querying and plotting geographic information for ipv4 and ipv6 addresses via the [MaxMind GeoLite2 dataset](https://www.maxmind.com/).

### Built with

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/)
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)

### development

The development environment is configured using `docker-compose`. In order to run iplocate locally:

1. Configure environment:
   - copy the dev.example.env file to a new file called .env: `cp example.env .env`
   - add MaxMind account id and license key credentials to the `.env` file where appropriate. Access is free and an account can be created [here](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite2/signup).
2. Start the environment:
   - From the root of the project, start environment using docker: `docker-compose up --build`
   - Local changes in `backend/src` and `frontend/src` will be hot-reloaded
   - Other changes will require stopping and starting the environment
3. Navigate to [http://localhost](http://localhost) in a browser

### testing

In order to run unit tests

1. Install backend dependencies (outside of docker)
   - cd `./backend`
   - `npm install`
2. Install frontend dependencies (outside of docker)
   - cd `./frontend`
   - `npm install`
3. From either directory
   - Run unit tests: `npm run test`
   - Run unit tests with coverage: `npm run test:coverage`
   - Format code using prettier: `npm run format`
   - Check formatting: `npm run format:check`

### Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. Prior to committing, run unit tests and formatting. Code coverage is required to be above 90%.

### CI/CD

GitHub Actions is used for CI/CD. Backend CI configuration can be found in [.github/workflows/backend.yml](https://github.com/jhackshaw/iplocate/blob/master/.github/workflows/backend.yml), and frontend configuration can be found in [.github/workflows/frontend.yml](https://github.com/jhackshaw/iplocate/blob/master/.github/workflows/frontend.yml). Every PR triggers the following steps in both:

1. Install nodejs and dependencies (npm ci)
2. Ensure prettier code style (npm format:check)
3. Run tests (npm run test:coverage)
4. Build production application (npm run build)

Every push to master triggers the following deployment steps with the deploy workflow in [.github/workflows/deploy.yml](https://github.com/jhackshaw/iplocate/blob/master/.github/workflows/deploy.yml)

1. Deploy infrastructure changes using terraform
2. Deploy backend using serverless framework
3. Deploy frontend to Netlify
